# ML_course_Task6

In this task you are asked to work with the *bankloans.xlsx* file (see the case-study discussion from the lecture). Each group works with its own indicator of **default on loans**.
- othdebt

Split the values of your indicator into **two** groups: one with **default = 0** and the other with **default = 1**.
Use the **5% level of significance** for statistical inference.
